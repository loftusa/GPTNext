WARNING: BNB_CUDA_VERSION=124 environment variable detected; loading libbitsandbytes_cuda124.so.
This can be used to load a bitsandbytes version that is different from the PyTorch CUDA version.
If this was unintended set the BNB_CUDA_VERSION variable to an empty string: export BNB_CUDA_VERSION=
If you use the manual override make sure the right libcudart.so is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
For example by adding the following to your .bashrc: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_cuda_dir/lib64
